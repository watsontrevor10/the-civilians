          The Civilians are, in a literal sense, weekend warriors. They each
          serve as musicians in the U.S. Army. As Army musicians these five have
          been performing together for over a decade, and have performed
          extensively throughout the state and abroad supporting our troops and
          local communities of Utah.
        </p>
        <p>
          As The Civilians, they are well-versed in multiple genres; but focus
          heavily on popular, danceable tunes that appeal to a wide range of
          audiences. They bring that decade of performing experience to the
          Civilian side to create amazing experiences for audiences, and for any
          event.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whether as soldiers or Civilians, they want to continue performing and
          spreading their love of music and freedom to everyone around them.
          They are a group of patriotic rock stars, ready to turn any event into
          a party, and take that party to the next level.
