            Engineer by day, Swiss-army-knife multi-instrumentalist by night.
            Anything the song demands, Morgan plays, and does it well.

            A music teacher with a passion for an obscure band called The
            Beatles. But we don't hold that against him, because this man can
            shred on the guitar.

            Those who can't do teach, and those who can't teach teach gym. While
            he does teach gym, those words don't apply to his guitar playing, or
            vocal prowess.

            Neil "Taxman" Baxter is (you guessed it) a taxman by day, and a
            solid drummer by night. Besides keeping the rhythm, he also watches
            the books.

            Bassist. Yep, that's what he does. He also builds our websites. If
            he wasn't so good at both, we probably wouldn't keep him around.
